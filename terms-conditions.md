# Terms & Conditions for RelayBot

These Terms & Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of RelayBot ("the bot," "we," "us," "our") on the Discord platform. By adding RelayBot to your Discord server or by using its commands, you agree to be bound by these Terms and the RelayBot [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/shaggyze/RelayBot/blob/main/privacy-policy.md).

If you do not agree to these terms, you must not use the bot and should remove it from your Discord server immediately.

#### 1. The Service

RelayBot is a service that relays messages, including text, attachments, and other content, between configured channels on Discord ("the Service"). The Service is provided "as is" and "as available." We do not guarantee that the Service will always be available, uninterrupted, or error-free. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service at any time without notice.

#### 2. Relationship to Discord

RelayBot is a third-party application that operates on the Discord platform. Your use of the bot is also governed by Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines). We are not affiliated with, sponsored, or endorsed by Discord Inc. We are not responsible for any actions taken by Discord, including suspension or termination of your account.

#### 3. Acceptable Use

You agree that you will not use RelayBot to:
*   Transmit any content that violates Discord's Terms of Service or Community Guidelines, including but not limited to, spam, harassment, hate speech, or illegal content.
*   Engage in any activity that disrupts or interferes with the bot's operation or its underlying infrastructure.
*   Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the bot's systems or data.

You are solely responsible for the content you transmit through the Service. We reserve the right to take appropriate action, including blocking users, servers, or relay groups from using the Service if they are found to be in violation of these terms.

#### 4. User-Generated Content

RelayBot relays content generated by users. We do not create, endorse, or take responsibility for any user-generated content transmitted through the Service. The views expressed by users are their own and do not represent our views or values.

As a server administrator, you are responsible for the configuration of the bot on your server and for the content being relayed within your groups.

#### 5. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability

**No Warranty:** The Service is provided without any warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not guarantee the accuracy, timeliness, performance, completeness, or reliability of the Service. Your use of the Service is entirely at your own risk.

**Limitation of Liability:** To the fullest extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or data, whether incurred directly or indirectly, arising from your use of, or inability to use, the Service. This includes, but is not limited to, any damages resulting from:
*   Errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of relayed content.
*   Service interruptions or unavailability.
*   Bugs, viruses, or other harmful code that may be transmitted through the Service.
*   Unauthorized access to or use of our systems.
