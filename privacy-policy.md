# Privacy Policy for RelayBot

This Privacy Policy explains how RelayBot ("the bot," "we," "us") collects, uses, and stores information when you add it to a Discord server or interact with its services.

We respect your right to privacy and are committed to being transparent about our practices.

#### 1. What Information We Collect

RelayBot is designed to relay messages between channels. To do this, we need to collect and store certain types of information:

*   **User Information:** Your Discord User ID, username, and avatar. This is collected to display who sent a relayed message.
*   **Server (Guild) Information:** The Discord Server ID, Server Name, and Channel IDs where the bot is configured. This is necessary to know where to receive messages from and where to send them.
*   **Message Content:** The content of messages you send in a linked channel, which may include text, attachments (files), embeds, and stickers. This is the core data that the bot relays.
*   **Configuration Data:** Information provided by server administrators, such as relay group names, webhook URLs, and role mappings.
*   **Aggregated Usage Statistics:** The bot may collect aggregated, non-identifiable data, such as the character count of relayed messages, for the purpose of monitoring service usage and rate limiting.

**We do not collect:**
*   Your email address, phone number, or any other personal information from your Discord account not listed above.
*   Any message content from channels where the bot is not explicitly configured to operate.

#### 2. How We Collect Your Information

We collect information in the following ways:
*   **When an Administrator configures the bot:** Server IDs, Channel IDs, and Webhook URLs are stored when a server administrator sets up a relay.
*   **When you send a message:** When you send a message in a channel that is part of a relay group, the bot processes that message's content, your user information, and any attachments.
*   **When you use a slash command:** The bot processes the command and the options you provide.

#### 3. Use of Your Information

Your information is used exclusively to provide and improve the services of RelayBot. Specifically:

*   **To provide the core service:** We use your User Information and Message Content to relay messages to other configured channels and servers.
*   **For attribution:** Your username and avatar are displayed in the relayed message so other users know who sent it.
*   **For bot functionality:** Stored configuration data is used to manage which channels are linked and how features like role mentions are handled.
*   **For service administration:** Aggregated usage statistics help the bot owner understand service load and enforce fair use policies (rate limits).

We will never sell your information or share it with third parties for marketing purposes. The only "sharing" of your information is the act of relaying your message to another Discord server as configured by the administrators of the relay group.

#### 4. Data Storage and Security

Relayed message metadata, configuration data, and usage statistics are stored in a database managed by the bot owner. We take reasonable steps to protect this information from unauthorized access. However, no system is perfectly secure, and we are not liable for any unauthorized access to this information.

#### 5. Managing Your Information

You have control over your information in the following ways:

*   **Your Discord Account:** You can change your username and avatar at any time through your Discord client. These changes will be reflected in subsequent relayed messages.
*   **Your Messages:** You can delete your messages in Discord. If the relay group is configured for it, deleting your original message may also delete the relayed copies in other servers.
*   **Server Configuration:** Server administrators are responsible for the bot's configuration on their server. If you want a channel removed from a relay, please contact your server's administrator.
*   **Data Removal:** To request the removal of your personal data from the bot's database, please contact the bot owner.

#### 6. Complaints About Privacy

If you have any complaints about our privacy practices, please feel free to contact the bot owner with details of your complaint (e.g., by joining the official support server). We take complaints very seriously and will respond promptly.

#### 7. Third-Party Services

**Discord:**
RelayBot operates entirely on the Discord platform. Your use of Discord is subject to Discord's own [Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).

#### 8. Changes to This Policy

Please be aware that we may change this Privacy Policy in the future. We will notify users of any significant changes, for example, through a message in a support server or other official channel. Please check back from time to time for the latest version.
